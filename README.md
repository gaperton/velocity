# Velocity App for Fitbit Ionic

The Velocity application turns Fitbit Ionic to the smart digital compass and speedometer using the data taken from the onboard GPS receiver. Can be used as a backup navigation solution when hiking and walking, and is an invaluable tool for the small sailboat helping you to understand how well the sails are trimmed or keep the desired course.

## Features

- Shows the current and average speed (tap to switch between units).
- Indicate acceleration/slowdown with a color bar.
- Shows the rotating analog compass directed to the average heading (tap to switch between current/average heading).
- Lock mode to lock the average heading and increase compass resolution (down button to enable/disable)
- Calculates time to sunset/sunrise (time screen, click up button to switch between screens).

## FAQ

### GPS can't connect

GPS connection depends on satellites visibility and might take some time, especially for the "cold start" if you're starting it for the first time. Give it a few minutes and make sure you're not inside of a building. Normally, it will take somewhat about half a minute or less to connect if it's not a cold start and you're on open air. If you staying in the middle of the city with a skyscrapers blocking the sky it might take longer.

### Compass doesn't work

Keep in mind that Fitbit Ionic doesn't have the real compass and the heading is being taken from the GPS, and it's actually preferable when you're in a sailboat. It means that you need to be outdoors and move for the app to determine direction properly.
